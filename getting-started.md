# Getting Started

The firmware you selected at purchase is pre-flashed on your A2Pico. However, we recommend flashing A2Pico again if you're not 100% sure which firmware (variant) you chose, or simply want to make sure you're using the latest firmware.

Flashing your A2Pico is a breeze. All you need is a standard USB cable:
1. Press and hold the `BOOTSEL` button on the A2Pico.
2. Connect the A2Pico to a PC.
3. Release the `BOOTSEL` button. A new drive, `RPI-RP2`, will appear.
3. Copy the firmware `.uf2` file to the `RPI-RP2` drive, e.g., by drag & drop.
4. Disconnect the A2Pico from the PC. Done.

The latest A2retroNET firmware files can always be found at: https://github.com/oliverschmidt/a2retronet/releases/latest

There are two variants of the A2retroNET firmware:
* `A2retroNET.uf2` allows access to the Micro SD Card from a connected PC and also emulates a Super Serial Card.
* `A2retroNET-USB.uf2` allows the use of a USB Thumb Drive in addition to the Micro SD Card.

We recommend using a Micro SD Card for your first steps with both firmware variants. The Micro SD Card must be formatted with FAT, FAT32, or exFAT.

Now, with the flashed A2Pico and the formatted Micro SD Card at hand, perform the following steps:

1. Download the Total Replay .hdv file from https://archive.org/details/TotalReplay and save it as the only file in the root directory of the Micro SD Card.

2. Insert the Micro SD Card into the A2Pico and plug the A2Pico into an Apple II slot of your choice. We recommend slot 7.

3. Turn on the Apple II. On an Enhanced //e or IIgs, you'll see a countdown starting with `3` in the lower right corner. On a ][+ or original //e, you'll need to type `PR#7` to start the countdown.

4. Press the `C` key during the countdown.

5. In the menu that now appears, drive 1 should be selected at the top and the Total Replay .hdv file should be selected at the bottom. Simply press `RETURN` to insert the .hdv file into drive 1.

6. Press `ESC` to exit the menu and begin the actual boot process.

7. The Total Replay splash screen should now appear.
