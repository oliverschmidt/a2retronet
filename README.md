# A2retroNET

This project is based on [A2Pico](https://github.com/oliverschmidt/a2pico).

At the moment this project is in an early prototype stage. It implements a ProDOS 8 compatible mass storage controller with two block devices. Those block devices are represented by the two files `drive1.po`and `drive2.po` in the root directory of the FAT-formatted SD card.
